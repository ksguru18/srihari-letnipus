Background

    The Mt Wilson Java API is compatible with OSGi environments. This document
contains integration tips for OSGi environments.

Packaging

    The Java API is available in both jar and jar-with-dependencies formats. 
For OSGi environments, the jar format is more convenient. See the list
of {{./dependencies.html}} for details. A zip file is available containing
all the dependencies for convenience.

Integration

* JAXB

    After you create the api object, call setJaxbClassLoader in order to set the
OSGi class loader that should be used when deserializing XML with JAXB.

+---
File directory = new File(System.getProperty("user.home", "."));
String username = "test1"; // username created during registration
String password = "changeit"; // password created during registration
URL server = new URL("https://192.168.30.212:8181"); // your Mt Wilson server
ApiClient api = KeystoreUtil.clientForUserInDirectory(directory, username, password, server);
api.setJaxbClassLoader(osgiClassLoader);
