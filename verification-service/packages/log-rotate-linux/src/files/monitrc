## Configuration options and examples can be found here:
## http://mmonit.com/monit/documentation/monit.html

# intervals.  This defines the length of time of a single 'cycle' as used in 
# the process monitor triggers

set daemon 120

# configuration, actual services parameters or manage the services using the
# web interface.  This is disabled by default.
